DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
Today, DevOps is arguably the single most influential trend in software development.

Right now, there are over 17,000 DevOps engineer roles advertised on Indeed.com in the USA alone with an average salary range of $96,600-$122,000.
